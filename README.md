# GitHub Issues Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview
Currently, teams spend 15-20 minutes per ticket (or a backlog item) for triaging. To triage means to understand what a ticket is, what is its priority and thinking of a suitable engineer for that. Instead of thinking about how to resolve the ticket, we wasted time on triaging.
TicketForge is an AI-Powered DevOps ticket assignment system capable of automating the time-consuming manual process of assigning tickets. It can recommend optimal assignments based on engineer skills, past performances and ticket requirements.

### Folder Structure

> [!NOTE]
> Each folder contains documentation in the form of a `README.md` for how to run the apps/libs etc (or will contain it if not present already).

## Workspace Documentation

Each workspace has its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions:

### Applications
- [**training**](./apps/training/README.md) - ML model training pipeline for ticket time prediction
- [**web-backend**](./apps/web-backend/README.md) - FastAPI service for model serving and business logic
- [**web-frontend**](./apps/web-frontend/README.md) - Astro-based dashboard UI

### Libraries
- [**ml-core**](./libs/ml-core/README.md) - Core ML utilities and data schemas
- [**shared**](./libs/shared/README.md) - Common utilities (caching, configuration, logging)

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses [uv workspaces](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) and [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) since this project is laid out like a monorepo. Make sure you are familiar with both before continuing (i.e. make sure you know where to run install and package add commands)!

Here we guide you through the steps to install the tooling and dependencies needed to run our application.

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), [node 22 and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), and [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

2. Then run: `just`
  - This command installs all packages and configures the workspaces

3. Good to go!

## Usage

All usage scripts are defined in a `justfile` which can be run.
```sh
$ just --list
Available recipes:
    default               # Configure repository and install dependencies

    [data-pipeline]
    train *args=''        # runs the training script

    [lang-agnostic]
    check                 # runs all checks on the repo from repo-root
    install-deps          # install all 3rd party packages
    precommit *args='run' # Run pre-commit hooks

    [python]
    pycheck *args="."     # Run all python checks on particular files and directories
    pylint *args="."      # Runs python linting. Specify the directories/files to lint as positional args.
    pytest *args=''       # Runs python tests. Any args are forwarded to pytest.
```

## Development

This project includes linting, type checking, and testing tools to ensure code quality.

### Running Tests

To run python tests:
```sh
just pytest [...pytest arguments]
```

### Linting

#### Python
For the python projects, we use the following tools:

- This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and code formatting.
- This project uses [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for static type checking.

To invoke these just run, where you can specify a directory as optional arg

```sh
just pylint
just pylint path/to/dir
```

### Running All Checks

To run all quality checks (linting, type checking, and tests):
```sh
# Just python:
just pycheck                 # entire project
just pycheck apps/web-backend # just a single folder

# All languages
just check                   # entire project
```
