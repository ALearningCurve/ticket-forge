# Ticket Forge
TicketForge is an AI-Powered DevOps ticket assignment system capable of automating the time-consuming manual process of assigning tickets. It can recommend optimal assignments based on engineer skills, past performances and ticket requirements.

## Overview
Currently, teams spend 15-20 minutes per ticket (or a backlog item) for triaging. To triage means to understand what a ticket is, what is its priority and thinking of a suitable engineer for that. Instead of thinking about how to resolve the ticket, we wasted time on triaging.
